5. Fibonacci Series in Java.
6. Define an abstract class called Travel **[defined in package1]** with few appropriate data members and methods for getting and displaying the same,<br/>
a)create two subclasses called  *InternationalTravel*  and  *NationalTravel*  with new necessary data members respectively.<br/> 
b)Create at least three objects for both of the subclasses and just display the info in **package2** based on your travel experience so far.<br/> 
c)Also create a method which scans the places which you would like to travel along with tentative year, in which you may travel and display that as well **[Future plans]**.
7. Create a class called *Student* with Data members : <br/> 
(A) Regno <br/>
(B) Name <br/> 
(C) **static data member** named as Univ_name and static counter variable to store number of objects created and <br/> 
**Methods** : <br/>
(a) GetMethod <br/>
(b) PrintMethod <br/>
(c) Constructor <br/>
(d) Parametrized constructor <br/>
Also create a class called Courses with details like Course code,name,slot and venue along with necessary methods.<br/>
(I)Main method has to be provided in Registration class <br/> 
(II) create 4 course objects with two A1 slot courses, two B1 slot courses <br/>
(III)create two students objects and get display all course details to them and inform them to choose two subjects <br/>
(IV) if the selected courses have same slots, ask student to choose without clashing <br/>
(V) print the selected course in a table format with all necessary details.
8. Design a class called Participants with properties like *Name,Phno,Branch and University, TestResult_Classification[L1,L2,L3,L4,L5].* <br/>
Create a static method to display a message as follows based on the selection criteria,<br/>
(i) If student test result classification is **L1**, congratulate the student and inform that he/she has been selected for both Full time intership as well as Full time job. <br/>
(ii) If student test result classification is **L2 or L3**, inform the student that he/she has been selected for Full time intership and Job may be offered based on intership Performance. <br/>
(iii) If student test result classification is **L4 or L5,** inform that he/she has been selected for Part time intership of 21 days.<br/>
*Note*: 
A)Don’t use if statement for conditional check, instead use Switch Case statement.<br/>
B)Create atleast three Participants objects of array and then invoke static method to display the message.
9. Create a class person with datamembers like name,age, phno with methods getvalues and printvalues,<br/> 
I)store the class in a package called *pack1*.  
II)Define a class named student in subpackage *SubPack1* and *extend* the class defined as *person*.  
II)Use this class in a program of different package *Pack2*, create an **object** and invoke the methods defined in pack1 class file.
10. Create a program to take input from user as 1/2/3, <br/>
i)If user enters 1, display info about Arithmetic Exception, <br/>
ii)If enters 2 and 3 for Null pointer exception and Array index out of bound exception, respectively. <br/>
Use: try, Catch block for each exception individually.
11. Throw program example in JAVA.
12. **Five events** -  E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5 are going to be organized for Rivera in VIT, <br/> 
Registration is open for all B.Tech students. With the *total strength of 1000 students*, <br/> 
Simulate the registration for each event by generating 1000 random numbers in the range of 1 – 5.(1 for event E1 like wise).<br/> 
I)Store the values in an array.  
II)Create six threads to equally share the task of counting the number of registration details for all the events.  
III)Use synchronized method or synchronized block to update the count variables. 
IV)The main thread should receive the final registration count for all events and display the list of students who have not registered in any event.
13. **Java Famous problem - Roti Problem** <br/>
In a family, Mom prepares roti for her children.Mom makes roti and stacks it up in a vessel, and Children eats from it. <br/>
I)The max capacity of the vessel is 10. <br/>
II)If roti empties, Children wait for mom to prepare new roti. <br/>
Develop a program for the given scenario using **inter thread communication concept** in Java programming.
14. Write your information *[as string as well as MyInfo Class object]* like regno, name, cgpa and phno into a file <br/>
a)Read from the file and print in the console. <br/> 
b)Use Serialization and Deserialization in the program. <br/>
15. Traverse a file (.txt) and count the words **CSE1007** and **JAVA**, print the count of these words (Total count of "CSE1007" like this) in console.<br/>
*Note* - Also include other words in that file. 
16. **OddEvenTest** :- Checking number is *odd or even* using Java recursive approch & User defined methods.
17. Maximum number in array using **User defined method** in Java.
18. Checking number is *strong* or not in Java <br/> 
**Note** - Strong number is a number whose sum of all digits’ factorial is equal to the number ‘n’. example : 145 = 1! + 4! + 5! 
19. Make 2 **linked list** add numbers in it. print multiplication of corresponding index numbers in another linked list.
20. Java Program to add two integers but take integers **input as String**.Convert String to int *(without type conversion)* and add integers.
21. Java Magic Number program. <br/>
Magic number is -> Consider an example ,  325 is a magic number because the sum of its digits (3+2+5) is 10, and again sum up the resultant (1+0), <br/>
we get a single digit (1) as the result. Hence, the number 325 is a magic number.**Some other magic numbers are 1234, 226, 10, 1, 37, 46, 55, 73, etc.**
