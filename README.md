# Java_Codes
Different Java Codes.
1. calendar - Date and weekday finder in Java.
2. BMI calculator.
3. Vowelgram in Java.
4. Hostel registration program based on CGPA of student in Java (Multi-threading concepts and file handling with .txt file).
5. Fibonacci Series in Java.

6. Define an abstract class called Travel [defined in package1] with few appropriate data members and methods for getting and displaying the same, create two subclasses called    “InternationalTravel” and “NationalTravel” with new necessary data members respectively. Create at least three objects for both of the subclasses and just display the info in  package2 based on your travel experience so far. Also create a method which scans the places which you would like to travel along with tentative year, in which you may travel and display that as well.

7. Create a class called Student with Data members (1) Regno (2) Name (3)
static data member named as Univ_name and static counter variable to
store number of objects created and Methods (1) GetMethod (2)
PrintMethod (3)Constructor (4) Parametrized constructor
Also create a class called Courses with details like Course code, name,
slot and venue along with necessary methods.
(1)Main method has to be provided in Registration class
(2) create 4 course objects with two A1 slot courses, two B1 slot courses
(3)create two students objects and get display all course details to them
and inform them to choose two subjects
(4) if the selected courses have same slots, ask student to choose
without clashing
(5) print the selected course in a table format with all necessary details.

8. Design a class called Participants with properties like Name, Phno,
Branch and University, TestResult_Classification[L1,L2,L3,L4,L5]. Create a
static method to display a message as follows based on the selection
criteria,
(i) If student test result classification is L1, congratulate the student
and inform that he/she has been selected for both Full time
intership as well as Full time job
(ii) If student test result classification is L2 or L3, inform the student
that he/she has been selected for Full time intership and Job
may be offered based on intership Performance.
(iii) If student test result classification is L4 or L5, inform that he/she
has been selected for Part time intership of 21 days.
Create atleast three Participants objects of array and then invoke static
method to display the message.
Note: Don’t use if statement for conditional check, instead use Switch
Case statement.

9. Create a class person with datamembers like name,
age, phno with methods getvalues and printvalues, store
the class in a package called pack1. Define a class
named student in subpackage SubPack1 and extend
the class defined as person. Use this class in a program
of different package Pack2, create an object and invoke
the methods defined in pack1 class file.
