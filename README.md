# Java_Codes
Different Java Codes.
1. calendar - Date and weekday finder in Java.
2. BMI calculator.
3. Vowelgram in Java.
4. Hostel registration program based on CGPA of student in Java (Multi-threading concepts and file handling with .txt file).
5. Fibonacci Series in Java.

6. Define an abstract class called Travel [defined in package1] with few appropriate data members and methods for getting and displaying the same, create two subclasses called    “InternationalTravel” and “NationalTravel” with new necessary data members respectively. Create at least three objects for both of the subclasses and just display the info in  package2 based on your travel experience so far. Also create a method which scans the places which you would like to travel along with tentative year, in which you may travel and display that as well.

7. Create a class called Student with Data members (1) Regno (2) Name (3)
static data member named as Univ_name and static counter variable to
store number of objects created and Methods (1) GetMethod (2)
PrintMethod (3)Constructor (4) Parametrized constructor
Also create a class called Courses with details like Course code, name,
slot and venue along with necessary methods.
(1)Main method has to be provided in Registration class
(2) create 4 course objects with two A1 slot courses, two B1 slot courses
(3)create two students objects and get display all course details to them
and inform them to choose two subjects
(4) if the selected courses have same slots, ask student to choose
without clashing
(5) print the selected course in a table format with all necessary details.

8. Design a class called Participants with properties like Name, Phno,
Branch and University, TestResult_Classification[L1,L2,L3,L4,L5]. Create a
static method to display a message as follows based on the selection
criteria,
(i) If student test result classification is L1, congratulate the student
and inform that he/she has been selected for both Full time
intership as well as Full time job
(ii) If student test result classification is L2 or L3, inform the student
that he/she has been selected for Full time intership and Job
may be offered based on intership Performance.
(iii) If student test result classification is L4 or L5, inform that he/she
has been selected for Part time intership of 21 days.
Create atleast three Participants objects of array and then invoke static
method to display the message.
Note: Don’t use if statement for conditional check, instead use Switch
Case statement.

9. Create a class person with datamembers like name,
age, phno with methods getvalues and printvalues, store
the class in a package called pack1. Define a class
named student in subpackage SubPack1 and extend
the class defined as person. Use this class in a program
of different package Pack2, create an object and invoke
the methods defined in pack1 class file.

10. Create a program to take input from user as 1 /2 /3, if
user enters 1, display info about Arithmetic Exception, 2
and 3 for Null pointer exception and Array index out of
bound exception, respectively. Use, Try, Catch block for
each exception individually.

11. Throw example in java 

12. Five events E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5 are going to be
organized for Rivera in VIT, registration is open for all
B.Tech students. With the total strength of 1000
students, simulate the registration for each event by
generating 1000 random numbers in the range of 1 – 5.
(1 for event E1, 2 for E2… 5 for E5) and store the values
in an array. Create six threads to equally share the task
of counting the number of registration details for all the
events. Use synchronized method or synchronized block
to update the count variables. The main thread should
receive the final registration count for all events and
display the list of students who have not registered in
any event.


13. In a family, Mom prepares roti for her children. Mom makes
roti and stacks it up in a vessel, and Children eats from it. The
max capacity of the vessel is 10. If roti empties, Children wait
for mom to prepare new roti. Develop a program for the given
scenario using inter thread communication concept in Java
programming.

14. Write your information [as string as well as
MyInfo Class object] like regno, name, cgpa
and phno into a file and read from the file and
print in the console. Use Serialization and
Deserialization in the program
